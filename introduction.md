# Introduction

Gildsmith is an ecommerce platform built with a strong focus on developer
experience. After encountering challenges with existing systems—particularly
in terms of code structure and flow—we decided to create something different:
a simpler, more intuitive solution.

## Core Principles

Gildsmith is built on clear principles. We avoid overly complex classes that
add little value and instead prioritise simplicity and clarity in our code.
The aim is to ensure that the codebase remains clean, maintainable, and
accessible.

## Modern Technologies

Gildsmith leverages modern, reliable technologies—not overhyped trends.
Here’s what we use

- **Frontend (FE)**: The frontend is completely decoupled from the backend and
  is built using Vue.js, offering a responsive and dynamic user experience.
- **Backend (BE)**: The backend is powered by Laravel, chosen for its extensive
  out-of-the-box features and robust event-driven architecture.
- **Databases (DB)**: We use a combination of three databases, each selected
  for its strengths:
    - **MySQL**: For structured, relational data management.
    - **Redis**: For efficient caching and queue management.
    - **MongoDB**: For handling diverse and complex product data formats
      commonly found in ecommerce systems.

Testing is a key part of our development process. While not every single
component is unit-tested yet, all core functionalities are covered. Our
goal is to achieve comprehensive test coverage to ensure reliability.

We also enforce code quality through linters, ensuring consistency and
maintaining high standards across the codebase.

## Why Gildsmith?

Gildsmith is designed to make your development process smoother and more efficient. 
With a clean codebase and thorough documentation, you can focus on building your
ecommerce solution without unnecessary complications.


As Gildsmith moves into its Beta phase, you'll have access to tools that simplify
development, including a Docker environment tailored specifically for the Gildsmith stack.
